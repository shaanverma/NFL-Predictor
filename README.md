# NFL-Predictor

This repo compares compares several neural network models to predict NFL player data.

1) Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

2) Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)

3) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

4) Spiking Neural Networks (SNN)


<h1>NFL Data</h1>
The nflgame python api was used to load the player data in the analysis and examples.
